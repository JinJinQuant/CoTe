# Array

An array stores data in blocks of sequential memories.

Limitations
1. All data in an array must be of the same type


Advantages
We can answer the question how big the array is?
24 bites to access the third element 
Junmp to the index we want to search directly (by going to the memory of index * the size of data)
Really fast
