### Description of Each Directory

- **`arrays/`**: Contains examples, exercises, and solutions related to arrays.
- **`linked-lists/`**: Contains examples, exercises, and solutions related to linked lists.
- **`stacks/`**: Contains examples, exercises, and solutions related to stacks.
- **`queues/`**: Contains examples, exercises, and solutions related to queues.

Each directory has its own `README.md` file that provides an overview of the data structure, how to use the examples, and details about the exercises.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures.git
   cd data-structures
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Data Structure Directory**:
   Each data structure has its own directory. Navigate to the one you are interested in:
   ```bash
   cd linked-lists
   ```

3. **Compile and Run Examples**:
   Examples are provided in the `examples/` directory. Compile and run the examples using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ examples/singly_linked_list.cpp -o singly_linked_list
   ./singly_linked_list
   ```

4. **Solve Exercises**:
   Exercises are provided in the `exercises/` directory. Try solving them on your own before looking at the solutions.
